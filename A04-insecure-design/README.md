# Insecure Design â€” OWASP Top 10 Go Exercise

**Goal**: Explore the vulnerability, write tests that reproduce it, fix the code, and document the mitigation.

**How to run**:
1. `cd A04-insecure-design`
2. `go run .`
3. Use curl or a browser to interact with the endpoint described in the source code.

**Tasks**:
- Run the starter program and reproduce the insecure behavior.
- Write unit/integration tests that demonstrate the vulnerability.
- Implement fixes and re-run tests to show they're resolved.
- Update this README with the remediation steps and lessons learned.

**Notes**: These examples are intentionally insecure for learning. Do NOT deploy them to production.
